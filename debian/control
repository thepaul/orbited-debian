Description: Bidirectional bridge from browser (Javascript) to TCP socket
 Orbited provides a pure Javascript/HTML socket in the browser. It is a web
 router and firewall that allows you to integrate web applications with
 arbitrary back-end systems. You can implement any network protocol in the
 browser - without resorting to plugins.
 .
 Orbited ships with support for many protocols out of the box, including IRC,
 XMPP, and STOMP (ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ).
 .
 It works in all modern browsers, cross-port and cross-subdomain, with no
 loading bars, clicks, or spurious history entries. It uses only web standards
 to provide the most future-proof API and implementation.
